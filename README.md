# DinguxCommander

DinguxCommander is a file manager for MiyooCFW.
It uses two vertical panels side by side, one being the source and the other the
destination, like many 'commander-style' file managers such as Norton Commander
or Midnight Commander.
DinguxCommander allows to:

* Copy, move and delete multiple files.
* View a file
* Execute a file
* Rename a file or directory
* Create a new directory
* Display disk space used by a list of selected files/dirs
* Display disk information (used, available, total)

## Building
1. Set up your environment with legacy dynamic uClibc toolchain: 

```
cd
wget https://github.com/steward-fu/miyoo/releases/download/v1.0/toolchain.7z
7za x toolchain.7z
sudo cp -a miyoo /opt/
```

2. Build output with Makefile for MiyooCFW:

```
make -f Makefile.miyoo
```
